ABOUT
=====
I'm a bot poker programmer, and in order to test my bot, I needed a poker software. 
So I decided to use pokerth and patched it so that it can use "so library" as IA
report bug to me: ramone.castillon@gmail.com
website: http://code.google.com/p/bot-pokerth


BUILD
======
run ./build.sh to build bot pokerth
It will get pokerth source, and will apply bot-pokerth patches.

I have tested it on linux debian testing 64 bits.
To get all needed dependecies, just run apt-get build-dep pokterh

RUNNING BOT-POKERTH
==================
just run pokerth !
it run the same way as the official pokerth
if you want to use your own bot (in ia library), then edit config_ia.cfg
the first line of this will be the ia to use for the 1st computer opponement.
the second line will be the 2nd computer opponement.
If we cannot find the library, then it will use the default pokerth ia.

TODO
====
- We should update the UI in order to choose the ia we want
- cross compile windows binarie
